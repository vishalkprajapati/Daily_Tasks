Ques. Explain the concept of Recycle bin.

Ans. 1.The Recycle Bin is a location where deleted files or folders are temporarily stored.
     2. When a file or folder is deleted, it will remain in the Recycle Bin until you empty the Recycle Bin.
        If your hard drive is running low on disk space or has reached the Recycle Bin storage limit,
        files will begin being removed from the Recycle Bin.
     3. The Recycle Bin  is not a software program. The Recycle Bin is a feature of Windows 
        that you can think of as a folder on the computer that stores all deleted files and folders.
     4. Files are not removed when they are moved to the Recycle Bin, they are still taking up hard drive space.
